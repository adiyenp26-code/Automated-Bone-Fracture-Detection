Threshold Note (Baseline)
=========================

This model outputs a probability for the 'fractured' class.
A default threshold of 0.50 is used to convert probability into a binary decision.

Why 0.50?
- It is the standard starting point when the costs of false positives and false negatives
  are assumed equal.

How to tune for biomedical use:
- If the priority is to miss as few fractures as possible (higher sensitivity), lower the threshold.
- If the priority is to reduce false alarms (higher specificity), raise the threshold.

Suggested threshold (from ROC, Youden’s J):
- 0.0243 (maximizes sensitivity + specificity - 1 on this validation split)

Important note:
- Threshold tuning should be validated on an independent test set before any real clinical use.
