Threshold Note (Ensemble)

1) Standard threshold used for reporting = 0.50
   Reason: widely used default; easy to interpret; consistent across experiments.

2) ROC-based suggested threshold (Youden’s J) = 0.4611
   Meaning: maximizes (Sensitivity - False Positive Rate) on this validation split.
   In clinical workflows, threshold can be tuned depending on whether missing fractures
   (FN) is worse than false alarms (FP).

   Recommendation: keep 0.50 for baseline reporting, but discuss tuning as a future step.
